This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

You can find more help here (<https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html>).

Please install Python (if you are new to Python, download the Python 3.11 installer from <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/>).

```{python}
# Select Yes if asked "Would you like to create a default Python environment for the reticulate package"
# You will see something like:
# "Using Python: C:/Users/xxx/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/python.exe
# Creating virtual environment "r-reticulate" ... 
# + "C:/Users/xxx/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/python.exe" -m venv "C:/Users/xxx/Documents/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate"
# Done!" 
# 
# This means that R has set up a "virtual env" of Python. 
# A "virtual env" is like a clean install of Python that will not interfere with 
# your existing Python installs

If your click *Knit*, an HTML file containing the code and output will be produced and saved.
