        ● More on Functional Form

        ● More on using logarithmic functional forms
           • Convenient percentage/elasticity interpretation
           • Slope coefficients of logged variables are invariant to rescalings
           • Taking logs often eliminates/mitigates problems with outliers
           • Taking logs often helps to secure normality and homoskedasticity
           • Variables measured in units such as years should not be logged
           • Variables measured in percentage points should also not be logged
           • Logs must not be used if variables take on zero or negative values
           • It is hard to reverse the log-operation when constructing predictions

    ● Wage maximum with respect to work experience


                       Does this mean the return to experience 
                       becomes negative after 24.4 years?

                       Not necessarily. It depends on how many 
                       observations in the sample lie right of the
                       turnaround point.

                       In the given example, these are about 28% 
                       of the observations. There may be a speci-
                       fication problem (e.g. omitted variables).

        ● Average partial effects
           • In models with quadratics, interactions, and other nonlinear 
             functional forms, the partial effect depend on the values of one or 
             more explanatory variables
           • Average partial effect (APE) is a summary measure to describe the 
             relationship between dependent variable and each explanatory 
             variable
           • After computing the partial effect and plugging in the estimated 
             parameters, average the partial effects for each unit across the 
             sample

     • The adjusted R-squared imposes a penalty for adding new

     • The adjusted R-squared increases if, and only if, the t-statistic of a 
       newly added regressor is greater than one in absolute value

                              may even get negative

        ● Using adjusted R-squared to choose between nonnested 
          models
           • Models are nonnested if neither model is a special case of the other


           • A comparison between the R-squared of both models would be 
             unfair to the first model because the first model contains fewer 
             parameters
           • In the given example, even after adjusting for the difference in 
             degrees of freedom, the quadratic model is preferred

        ● Controlling for too many factors in regression analysis

        ● In some cases, certain variables should not be held fixed
           • In a regression of traffic fatalities on state beer taxes (and other 
             factors) one should not directly control for beer consumption
           • In a regression of family health expenditures on pesticide usage 
             among farmers one should not control for doctor visits

        ● Different regressions may serve different purposes
           • In a regression of house prices on house characteristics, one would 
             only include price assessments if the purpose of the regression is to 
             study their validity; otherwise one would not include them

        ● Adding regressors to reduce the error variance
           • Adding regressors may excarcerbate multicollinearity problems
           • On the other hand, adding regressors reduces the error variance 
           • Variables that are uncorrelated with other regressors should be 
             added because they reduce error variance without increasing 
             multicollinearity
           • However, such uncorrelated variables may be hard to find

        ● Example: Individual beer consumption and beer prices
           • Including individual characteristics in a regression of beer 
             consumption on beer prices leads to more precise estimates of the 
             price elasticity
