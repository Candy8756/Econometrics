    ● Qualitative Information
     • Examples: gender, race, industry, region, rating grade, …
     • A way to incorporate qualitative information is to use dummy 
       variables
     • They may appear as the dependent or as independent variables

    ● A single dummy independent variable


        = the wage gain/loss if the person Dummy variable:
        is a woman rather than a man =1 if the person is a woman 
        (holding other things fixed) =0 if the person is man

                       i.e. the difference in mean wage between 
                       men and women with the same level of 
                       education.

    ● Dummy variable trap
                   This model cannot be estimated (perfect collinearity)


   When using dummy variables, one category always has to be omitted:

                          The base category are men

                          The base category are women


   Alternatively, one could omit the intercept: Disadvantages: 
                           1) More difficult to test for diffe-
                           rences between the parameters
                           2) R-squared formula only valid
                           if regression contains intercept

    ● Estimated wage equation with intercept shift


                         Holding education, experience, 
                         and tenure fixed, women earn 
                         $1.81 less per hour than men


    ● Does that mean that women are discriminated against?
     • Not necessarily. Being female may be correlated with other produc-
       tivity characteristics that have not been controlled for.

    ● Comparing means of subpopulations described by dummies


                      Not holding other factors constant, women 
                      earn $2.51per hour less than men, i.e. the 
                      difference between the mean wage of men 
                      and that of women is $2.51.

    ● Discussion
     • It can easily be tested whether difference in means is significant
     • The wage difference between men and women is larger if no other 
       things are controlled for; i.e. part of the difference is due to differ-
       ences in education, experience, and tenure between men and 
       women

    ● Further example: Effects of training grants on hours of training

    Hours training per employee Dummy variable indicating whether firm received a 
                 training grant


    ● This is an example of program evaluation
     • Treatment group (= grant receivers) vs. control group (= no grant)
     • Is the effect of treatment on the outcome of interest causal?

    ● Using dummy explanatory variables in equations for log(y)


                           Dummy indicating 
                           whether house is of 
                           colonial style


                          As the dummy for colonial 
                          style changes from 0 to 1, 
                          the house price increases 
                          by 5.4 percentage points

    ● Using dummy variables for multiple categories
     • 1) Define membership in each category by a dummy variable
     • 2) Leave out one category (which becomes the base category)


    Holding other things fixed, married 
    women earn 19.8% less than single 
    men (= the base category)

    ● Incorporating ordinal information using dummy variables

    ● Example: City credit ratings and municipal bond interest rates

     Municipal bond rate Credit rating from 0-4 (0=worst, 4=best)


   This specification would probably not be appropriate as the credit rating only contains 
   ordinal information. A better way to incorporate this information is to define dummies:


   Dummies indicating whether the particular rating applies, e.g. CR1=1 if CR=1, and CR1=0 
   otherwise. All effects are measured in comparison to the worst rating (= base category).

    ● Interactions involving dummy variables
                                Interaction term
    ● Allowing for different slopes


           =  intercept men =  slope men

           =  intercept women =  slope women

    ● Interesting hypotheses


          The return to education is the The whole wage equation is 
          same for men and women the same for men and women

                          and women

    ● Estimated wage equation with interaction term 


                  Does this mean that there is no significant evidence of 
    No evidence against hypothesis that lower pay for women at the same levels of educ, exper, 
    the return to education is the same and tenure? No: this is only the effect for educ = 0. To 
    for men and women answer the question one has to recenter the interaction 
                  term, e.g. around educ = 12.5 (= average education).

    ● Null hypothesis    All interaction effects are zero, i.e. the 
                         same regression coefficients apply to 
                         men and women

                             are zero cannot be

    ● Joint test with F-statistic Null hypothesis is rejected


    ● Alternative way to compute F-statistic in the given case
     • Run separate regressions for men and for women; the unrestricted 
       SSR is given by the sum of the SSR of these two regressions
     • Run regression for the restricted model and store SSR
     • If the test is computed in this way it is called the Chow-Test
     • Important: Test assumes a constant error variance accross groups

                         of about 50%.

    ● Disadvantages of the linear probability model
     • Predicted probabilities may be larger than one or smaller than zero
     • Marginal probability effects sometimes logically impossible
     • The linear probability model is necessarily heteroskedastic

                               noulli variable

     • Heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors need to be computed

    ● Advantanges of the linear probability model
     • Easy estimation and interpretation
     • Estimated effects and predictions are often reasonably good in 
       practice

    ● More on policy analysis and program evaluation

    ● Example: Effect of job training grants on worker productivity

      The firm‘s scrap rate =1 if firm received training grant, =0 otherwise


                              No apparent effect of 
                              grant on productivity


     Treatment group: grant receivers, Control group: firms that received no grant

     Grants were given on a first-come, first-served basis. This is not the same as giving them out 
     randomly. It might be the case that firms with less productive workers saw an opportunity to 
     improve productivity and applied first.

    ● Self-selection into treatment as a source for endogeneity
     • In the given and in related examples, the treatment status is 
       probably related to other characteristics that also influence the 
       outcome
     • The reason is that subjects self-select themselves into treatment 
       depending on their individual characteristics and prospects

    ● Experimental evaluation
     • In experiments, assignment to treatment is random
     • In this case, causal effects can be inferred using a simple regression

                    The dummy indicating whether or not there was 
                    treatment is unrelated to other factors affecting 
                    the outcome.

     • It is important to control for other characteristics that may be 
       important for loan approval (e.g. profession, unemployment)
     • Omitting important characteristics that are correlated with the non-
       white dummy will produce spurious evidence for discrimination
