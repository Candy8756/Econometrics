        ● Discussion of the normality assumption
           • In many cases, normality is questionable or impossible by definition
           • Examples where normality cannot hold:
               • Wages (nonnegative; also: minimum wage)
               • Number of arrests (takes on a small number of integer values)
               • Unemployment (indicator variable, takes on only 1 or 0)
           • In some cases, normality can be achieved through transformations    
             of the dependent variable (e.g. use log(wage) instead of wage)
           • Important: For the purposes of statistical inference, the assumption   
             of normality can be replaced by a large sample size

                                           If the standardization is done using the estimated 
                                           standard deviation (= standard error), the normal

              Note: The t-distribution is close to the standard normal distribution if n-k-1 is large.

                                      The population parameter is equal to zero, i.e. after

         ●   How the p-value is computed (here: two-sided test)?


                                                       The p-value is the significance level at which

                                                       rejecting the null hypothesis. 

     These would be the 
     critical values for a                             In the two-sided case, the p-value is thus the 
     5% significance level                             probability that the t-distributed variable takes 
                                                       on a larger absolute value than the realized

                                                       From this, it is clear that a null hypothesis is 
                                                       rejected if and only if the corresponding p-
                                                       value is smaller than the significance level.
                     value of test statistic
                                                       For example, for a significance level of 5% the 
                                                       t-statistic would not lie in the rejection region.

        ● Guidelines for discussing economic and statistical significance
           • If a variable is statistically significant, discuss the magnitude of the 
             coefficient to get an idea of its economic or practical importance
           • The fact that a coefficient is statistically significant does not 
             necessarily mean it is economically or practically significant!
           • If a variable is statistically and economically important but has the 
             “wrong” sign, the regression model might be misspecified
