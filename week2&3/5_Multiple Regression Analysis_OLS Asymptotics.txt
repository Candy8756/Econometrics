        ● So far we focused on properties of OLS that hold for any 
          sample

        ● Properties of OLS that hold for any sample/sample size
           • Expected values/unbiasedness under MLR.1 – MLR.4
           • Variance formulas under MLR.1 – MLR.5
           • Gauss-Markov Theorem under MLR.1 – MLR.5
           • Exact sampling distributions/tests under MLR.1 – MLR.6

        ● Properties of OLS that hold in large samples Without assuming nor-
                                                       mality of the error term! 
           • Consistency under MLR.1 – MLR.4
           • Asymptotic normality/tests under MLR.1 – MLR.5

        ● Consistency

          An estimator      is consistent for a population parameter   if

                                for arbitrary            and             .

         Alternative notation:
                                            The estimate converges in proba-
                                            bility to the true population value
        ● Interpretation:
           • Consistency means that the probability that the estimate is arbitrari-   
             ly close to the true population value can be made arbitrarily high by 
             increasing the sample size

        ● Consistency is a minimum requirement for sensible estimators

    ● Theorem 5.1 (Consistency of OLS)


    ● Special case of simple regression model


                   One can see that the slope estimate is consistent 
                   if the explanatory variable is exogenous, i.e. un-
                   correlated with the error term.
    ● Assumption MLR.4‘


                 All explanatory variables must be uncorrelated with the 
                 error term. This assumption is weaker than the zero 
                 conditional mean assumption MLR.4.

    ● For consistency of OLS, only the weaker MLR.4‘ is needed

    ● Asymptotic analog of omitted variable bias

                     True model

                               Misspecified 
                               model


                                 Bias


                There is no omitted variable bias if the omitted variable is 
                irrelevant or uncorrelated with the included variable

        ● Asymptotic normality and large sample inference
           • In practice, the normality assumption MLR.6 is often questionable
           • If MLR.6 does not hold, the results of t- or F-tests may be wrong
           • Fortunately, F- and t-tests still work if the sample size is large 
             enough
           • Also, OLS estimates are normal in large samples even without MLR.6

        ● Theorem 5.2 (Asymptotic normality of OLS)

            Under assumptions MLR.1 – MLR.5:

                                  In large samples, the 
                                  standardized estimates also 
                                  are normally distributed

    ● Practical consequences
     • In large samples, the t-distribution is close to the Normal(0,1) 
       distribution
     • As a consequence, t-tests are valid in large samples without MLR.6
     • The same is true for confidence intervals and F-tests
     • Important: MLR.1 – MLR.5 are still necessary, esp. homoskedasticity
