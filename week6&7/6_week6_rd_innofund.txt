Bureaucratic intervention grant receipt, we find that firms possessing observable merits and political connections are more likely to receive
China Innofund grants. We also find evidence of bureaucratic intervention, as applicants’ evaluation scores are non-

randomly missing and that some firms whose scores did not meet funding standards nonetheless received grants.
With regards to post-grant performance, we find that firms receiving high project evaluation scores and Innofund
grants perform better than those that do not receive grants and have lower scores. These do not appear to be
causal effects, however. Applying Fuzzy RD methods, we find no evidence that receiving an Innofund grant
boosts survival, patenting, or venture funding. Our analysis demonstrates the value of administrative data for
causal analysis and for uncovering evidence regarding the possibility that bureaucratic intervention affects firm
and program outcomes.
