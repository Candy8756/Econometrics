Importantly, the cause of death is also recorded after multiple
validation checks. We classify causes of death as either cardiore-
spiratory or noncardiorespiratory. The cardiorespiratory causes of
death that are those that have been linked to ambient air quality
and include heart disease (17), stroke (18–20), lung cancer (21),
and respiratory illnesses (22, 23). Causes of death presumably
unrelated to air quality include other cancers, accidental or violent
deaths, and various stomach ailments. Together, these two cate-
gories cover all causes of death.
We collected a range of determinants of mortality and life ex-

pectancy, besides TSPs, that are used as control variables in the
subsequent statistical analysis. We obtained daily average tem-
perature data for each location in the air pollution sample from
theWorld Meteorological Organization that was used to calculate
annual heating and cooling degree days (24). We also compiled
a series of variables from China’s 2000 census that are potentially
related to health outcomes: average education of county residents,
manufacturing’s share of employment, the percentage of residents
with urban registration, and the percentage of residents with ac-
cess to tap water. The data file also includes an income variable
taken from the DSP, which placed each site into one of four
income categories.

The striking finding is that there is a discrete decline in life ex-
