Threshold Events and Identification: A Study
of Cash Shortfalls

TOR-ERIK BAKKE and TONI M. WHITED∗

ABSTRACT
Threshold events are discrete events triggered when an observable continuous
variable passes a known threshold. We demonstrate how to use threshold events
as identification strategies by revisiting the evidence in Rauh (2006, Investment
and financing constraints: Evidence from the funding of corporate pension plans,
Journal of Finance 61, 33–71) that mandatory pension contributions cause invest-
ment declines. Rauh’s result stems from heavily underfunded firms that constitute a
small fraction of the sample and that differ sharply from the rest of the sample. To al-
leviate this issue, we use observations near funding thresholds and find causal effects
of mandatory contributions on receivables, R&D, and hiring, but not on investment.
We also provide useful suggestions and diagnostics for analyzing threshold events.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF CAUSAL EFFECTS is of central interest in empirical cor-
porate finance. One particularly interesting class of identification strategies
involves the use of threshold events, in which a discrete event or treatment oc-
curs when an observable continuous variable passes a known threshold. These
thresholds can occur because of accounting conventions, government regula-
tions, or contractual agreements, among other things. Given the increasing use
of identification strategies based on threshold events, the intent of this paper
is threefold.

First, we provide general guidance on how one can and cannot use threshold
events to identify causal relationships. We do so in the context of one of the first
and most prominent examples of the use of threshold events to obtain identifi-
cation: Rauh (2006). This paper is an ideal setting for understanding threshold
events because the institutional framework provides more than one type of
threshold to examine. The threshold events are the mandatory contributions
that firms must make to their defined benefit (DB) pension plans. These contri-
butions are a direct function of the level of pension plan funding (assets minus
liabilities), and they jump up discretely at several different funding thresholds.
The paper is also an ideal setting because it tackles the important question
of whether the cash shortfalls accompanying mandatory contributions cause

declines in investment. The challenge in identifying a causal relation is the
possibility that mandatory contributions are endogenously determined with
investment. Rauh finds that firms cut their capital expenditures 70 cents for
every dollar of mandatory contributions to their pension plans. The paper then
argues that this effect is causal because the jumps and kinks in the relation
between contributions and funding provide a source of exogenous variation
in cash flow and therefore identification of a causal effect of contributions on
investment.

However, although the use of pension funding rules to obtain identification
is clever, the result of a sharp cut in investment is puzzling because mandatory
contributions are on average tiny relative to capital expenditures. It is hard
to imagine that capital expenditures are sufficiently divisible to produce such
a strong effect, especially in light of evidence of substantial capital stock ad-
justment costs (Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006)). Given this background, the
second purpose of this paper is to understand the result of sharp investment
declines. Finally, the third purpose of the paper is to exploit in detail the rich
institutional setting of pension funding to determine exactly how firms respond
to cash shortfalls.

In short, we find that the strong sensitivity of investment to mandatory
contributions stems from heavily underfunded firms that constitute a small
fraction of the sample and that are different from the rest of the sample in
important ways, that is, the control group differs from the treated group. Thus,
though we find some evidence that this sensitivity is causal, one cannot ex-
trapolate or generalize the result beyond those severely underfunded firms,
and it is difficult to rule out the possibility that firm characteristics cause both
the pension underfunding and the investment declines. By closely examining
those observations near the various discontinuities in the rule relating contri-
butions to funding status, we find strong causal evidence that firms respond
to these cash shortfalls by managing accounts receivable. This result makes
sense given the existence of active secondary markets for receivables. We also
find less robust evidence that these shortfalls induce changes in other types of
working capital, employment growth, and R&D.

We also provide guidance on using threshold events to obtain identification.
Teasing out the direct causal effect of a threshold event can be difficult because
the forces that bring a firm to a threshold can also affect a firm’s actions, that is,
the variable (such as pension funding status) that defines the threshold is often
endogenous. We therefore frame our discussion in terms of the econometric
technique called regression discontinuity design (RDD), which sidesteps this
difficulty in an intuitive way. The discontinuous event induced by the threshold
rule induces a discontinuity in the actions taken by firms at the threshold.
Because observations immediately to one side of the threshold are unlikely to
differ in systematic ways from the observations immediately to the other side,
the former group acts as a valid control for the latter. Therefore, as long as firms
have imperfect control over their location vis-à-vis the threshold, a researcher
can measure the causal effect of the event.

Pension funding is an ideal setting for understanding how to use threshold
events for identification because it is not a strict application of RDD. Instead,

it shares some important features of RDD, in particular, threshold events.
Therefore, although examining the identification strategy in Rauh (2006) is
only somewhat useful for understanding when RDD works and when its results
can be misleading, such an examination is useful for exploring the broader
question of when it is valid to extend the intuition behind RDD to more general
regression settings.

We distill several important econometric takeaways from our analysis of
pension funding. We demonstrate that including discontinuous variables in
generic regressions usually does not provide identification, even if one controls
for the threshold variable that induces the discontinuity. This conclusion fol-
lows from the important point that RDD has strong local validity but weak ex-
ternal validity. Put differently, RDD ameliorates the endogeneity problems that
compromise clean inference only for those observations close to the threshold.
In this regard, using threshold events to obtain identification is analogous to
using any instrumental variables (IV) estimator. Just as IV estimators ob-
tain identification from those observations that are affected by the instrument,
threshold events usually only provide identification for those observations close
to the cutoff. To address these identification issues, we offer some useful robust-
ness checks for determining when threshold events are likely to be providing
identification.

In addition, our analysis highlights the importance of understanding firm
incentives and behavior when using threshold events as the basis for identifi-
cation strategies. First, unobserved firm behaviors can change at thresholds,
and these unobserved changes can have important effects on any outcome of
interest. Here, we provide guidance for detecting such situations. Second, and
more importantly, firms optimize subject to the constraints imposed by thresh-
old rules and endogenously choose whether they want to be close to a threshold.
That firms actively manage and anticipate future mandatory contributions is
vividly illustrated in this quote from Ford Motor Company’s 2005 10K:

In 2005, we made $2.5 billion of cash contributions to our funded pension
plans. During 2006, we expect to contribute $1.5 billion to our worldwide
pension plans. . . . Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do
not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension
plans in 2006.1

Clearly, Ford is planning its contributions in 2005 and 2006 to avoid having to
face unanticipated financial shocks in 2006. We point out that, although RDD
can remedy the endogeneity problems induced by such behavior, the identifica-
tion afforded by RDD can be invalidated if this behavior leads firms to bunch
on one side of a threshold or another. Fortunately, bunching does not pose a
problem in the case of pension funding because the distance from the threshold
is largely a function of stock market values, which are difficult to manipulate.

Third, threshold events are most likely to provide significant evidence when
these events are themselves significant. This point is illustrated by our finding

that the strongest evidence of changes in firm behavior occur around disconti-
nuities that entail the largest cash shortfalls.

Our paper clearly fits into the rapidly growing set of studies in finance and
economics that examine threshold events. Examples include changes in ac-
counting standards when a firm’s public float exceeds a certain level (Gao,
Wu, and Zimmerman (2009)) or cash inflows that stem from option exercise
(Babenko, Lemmon, and Tserlukevich (2011)). Further studies that explicitly
use RDD include Chava and Roberts (2008), Beshears (2010), Cuñat, Gine, and
Guadalupe (2011), and Keys, et al. (2010). These studies use RDD to measure
the causal effects of bond covenant violations, strategic alliances, shareholder
proposals, and loan securitization. Our paper also falls into a group of recent
applied econometrics papers that provide guidance to empirical researchers by
sorting through theoretical econometric results in concrete settings. For exam-
ple, Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004) consider inference in difference-
in-difference estimators, and Petersen (2009) examines the bias in standard
errors calculated with panel data. In terms of economic content, our paper
contributes to the extensive literature on financing constraints surveyed, for
example, in Stein (2003) and Hennessy and Whited (2007). In particular, our
paper helps clarify the common practice, dating back to the influential work of
Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988), of using the sensitivity of investment
to cash flow as a metric for gauging the severity of finance constraints.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section I, we provide a brief
review of the identification conditions for RDD. Sections II and III describe the
institutional setting and the data, respectively. Sections IV and V contain the
results, and Section VI concludes.

I. Review of Regression Discontinuity Design
We now outline the basic features of RDD, which was first introduced by

Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). More detailed presentations can be found
in Van der Klaauw (2002) and Imbens and Lemieux (2008). Our description fol-
lows the presentation in Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw (2001). We start with
the intuitive description in the introduction that firms just above and below
the threshold can be thought of as close-to-randomly assigned to a treatment,
for example, a pension funding violation. Therefore, by calculating the average
differences between the investment (or any other variable of interest) of these
two groups of firms, one can estimate the causal effect of the treatment.

More formally, let yi be a variable of interest, such as investment, employ-
ment, liquid assets, or external financing. We define yi1 as the outcome of firm
i given treatment (pension funding violation) and yi0 as the outcome of firm i
in the absence of treatment. The goal is to estimate yi1 − yi0, which is the effect
of treatment on firm i. It is important to note that yi1 and yi0 are the pair of
potential outcomes for firm i and that we only observe one of these variables for
each firm. We cannot roll back history and observe the other outcome, so this
unobserved outcome is the counterfactual, which we have to estimate. This
constraint forces us to focus on average effects of treatment over
(sub)populations rather than on individual effects.



A Study of Cash Shortfalls 1087

RDD comes in two flavors: sharp and fuzzy. We focus mainly on sharp in as
much as it is the type of RDD that is most relevant to the pension funding
threshold. Sharp RDD is distinguished by the key identifying assumption that
firms are assigned to treatment solely on the basis of an observed, continuous
measure s, called the selection (forcing, running, assignment) variable. The
restriction that s must be observable rules out threshold events such as ac-
counting disclosures in which the selection variable can only be observed on
one side of the threshold. The selection variable can be either a single variable
or a real-valued function of several variables. The observations that fall below
some deterministic cutoff point s̄ are placed in the control group, which we
denote by setting an indicator variable, wi, equal to zero. Those observations
on or above that point are placed in the treatment group, that is, wi = 1. To
summarize

wi = w (si) = 1 {si ≥ s̄} . (1)

A second identifying assumption is that the forcing variable, s, has a positive
density in a neighborhood of the cutoff s̄. This assumption rules out manip-
ulation of the forcing variable, which might result in either no observations
near the threshold or bunching of observations on one side of the threshold.
McCrary (2008) notes that some manipulation of the assignment variable can
be tolerated before identification is compromised, and he provides a test for de-
tecting manipulation. Of course, visual inspection of the density of the forcing
variable is the first way in which to address this issue because gross violations
are usually easily visible.

Note that si is allowed to affect the outcome. In other words, assignment to
treatment is not random. This condition is important because funding status
(si) depends on firm financial health, which in turn affects investment. To
understand how RDD identifies a causal effect in the face of this endogeneity
problem, we write the treatment effect estimation problem as a regression,

yi = β + αwi + ui, (2)

where β is a constant and α is the average treatment effect. For simplicity,
we assume that the treatment effect is constant across observations.2 The
regression error, ui, can be thought of as what would happen in the absence of
treatment. Running ordinary least squares (OLS) on this regression does not
produce causal inference because assignment to treated and control groups is
by definition not random, so the error, ui, is correlated with the regressor, wi.
In this setting, the key identifying assumption for sharp RDD—that si is the
sole determinant of treatment—can be restated as saying that the probability
of assignment jumps from zero to one at the cutoff. Formally,

lim Pr(wi = 1 | si) = 1
s↓s̄

)
lim Pr(wi = 1 | si) = (3

0.
s↑s̄

2 See Imbens and Lemieux (2008) for the more general case.



1088 The Journal of Finance©R

We now use this condition to show that the treatment effect, α, can be defined
as:

α = lim E (yi | si) − lim E yi | si) . (4)
s↓ s↑ (

s̄ s̄

This quantity is simply the difference between expected outcomes for those
observations just above and below the cutoff. To show that (4) holds, we first
subtract the right limit of (2) from the l(eft limit of (2). We obtain )

lim E (yi | si) − lim E
s↑ (yi | si) = α lim E

s↓ (wi | si) − lim E (w
s↓s̄ s↑ i | si)

s̄ ( s̄ s̄ )
+ lim E (u | si) − lim E (ui | si) .

s↓ i
s̄ s↑s̄ (5)

If we assume that E (ui | si) is continuous in si, then the last term goes to zero
and we hav(e ) / ( )

α = lim E (y | s) − lim E (y | s) lim E (w | s) − lim E (w | s) . (6)
s↓s̄ s↑s̄ s↓s̄ s↑s̄

If the probability of treatment does jump from zero to one at s̄, then the denom-
inator of (6) equals one, and we have (4). Equation (6) implies that a simple
way to estimate α is as the difference in means for the groups of observations
just above and below the cutoff. Expression (6) also makes it clear that the
assumption of a continuous density is crucial. Because limits of expectations
define the average treatment effect, if the density is discontinuous at s̄, these
limits do not exist.

The assumption that E (ui | si) is continuous in si is also crucial, and it is
therefore important to understand what this assumption means in economic
terms. On one level, if one takes regression (2) seriously, it states that the only
variable that should determine the outcome variable yi (investment, employ-
ment, etc.) is the selection variable. This interpretation is, of course, extreme,
but it points out that many determinants of yi are omitted from (2) and are
therefore implicitly contained in the error term, ui. The continuity assump-
tion then implies that none of these variables exhibits a discontinuity at the
exact threshold point. On another level, the continuity assumption formalizes
the notion that observations just above and below the cutoff are comparable.
Therefore, the continuity assumption goes hand-in-hand with the observation
that RDD provides sharp causal inference only near the cutoff.

Although RDD is typically a technique with strong internal (near the thresh-
old) validity and weak external (far from the threshold) validity, it is useful to
examine when one can extrapolate inferences that are valid near the thresh-
old to points away from the threshold. We start by examining sharp RDD and
applying the concept of a control function from Heckman and Robb (1985). In
sharp RDD, the only determinant of treatment is the selection variable, si, so
one can write the regression error, ui, in (2) as

ui = E (ui | si) + ei, (7)



A Study of Cash Shortfalls 1089

where ei is, by definition, orthogonal to wi = w (si) . Substituting (7) into (2)
then gives

yi = β + αw (si) + E (ui | si) + ei
= β + (

αw (si) + k (si) + e 8)
i,

where k (si) ≡ E (ui | si). In general, k (si) is a smooth function of si. If one esti-
mates (8) on points away from the cutoff, one can no longer rely on the local
continuity of ui to ensure that the treated and control groups are similar. One
must then not only include k (si) in the regression (and get the functional form
correct), but one must also control for the fact that observations away from
the cutoff may be systematically different from observations close to the cutoff.
These requirements are important for understanding the specific identifying
assumptions in Rauh (2006), which we discuss in detail in the next section.

II. Motivation and Institutional Setting
The identification strategy in this paper is not strictly based on RDD. How-

ever, it does share several features of RDD, in particular, the use of a threshold
rule. The rule states that a firm must make mandatory contributions when its
pension assets fall below its pension liabilities. Further, both the rate and level
of mandatory contributions can change at additional institutionally determined
levels of underfunding. The question is then whether the local identification
given by RDD can be extended to provide identification in the more general case
of using discontinuous variables, such as mandatory contributions in generic
regressions. To answer this question, we first review the institutional details
surrounding corporate defined benefit pension plans and then discuss the ex-
tent to which these details can deliver identification of causal effects.

Companies with DB pension plans promise employees a prespecified monthly
benefit at retirement. Typically, this benefit is calculated as a function of em-
ployee salary and service, and government rules state that firms must con-
tribute to their pension plans to be able to meet these future pension liabil-
ities. If the market value of these contributions (pension assets) exceeds the
expected future pension liabilities, the pension plan is considered overfunded.
Conversely, if the value of the pension assets is less than the pension liabilities,
the plan is considered underfunded. If the pension plan is overfunded, the firm
is free to either contribute or not contribute to the plan, although contributions
above a specified ceiling receive unfavorable tax treatment. If the firm with-
draws funds from an overfunded pension plan, it can be subject to severe excise
taxes. On the other hand, if the plan is underfunded, the firm is required to con-
tribute more funds to its pension plan. These mandatory pension contributions
(MPCs) are determined according to a government rule that is a discontinuous
and kinked function of the funding gap (the difference between pension assets
and liabilities).

Pension funding rules are interesting because they generate a clear thresh-
old event. In fact, because the rule has both discontinuities and kinks, the rule



1090 The Journal of Finance©R

provides more than one threshold event. Pension funding is also interesting
because the selection variable, the funding gap, is not likely to be completely
manipulable. Fluctuations in the funding gap are driven by the present value
of the pension liabilities, by plan contributions, and by the performance of
the invested pension assets. Firms have limited control over the actuarial as-
sumptions used to calculate the value of liabilities because these assumptions
are governed by restrictive Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules. Therefore,
although the firm can actively manipulate the pension funding gap by vol-
untary contributions, changes in employment, and changes in plan benefits,
fluctuations in the market value of pension assets and in the present value of
liabilities that accompany market interest rate changes are largely beyond the
firm’s control. Limitations on firms’ ability to manipulate the funding gap are
important for the use of threshold rules as identification strategies.

The example is interesting, finally, because of the transparency of the endo-
geneity problem. The question is whether internal resources affect investment,
and this question is interesting because the answer sheds light on whether
financial frictions affect real economic activity. However, it is difficult to de-
termine whether internal cash flows have a causal effect on firm investment
because unobservable changes in investment opportunities can drive both in-
vestment and cash flows. Further, the usual measure of investment opportuni-
ties, the market-to-book ratio, is unlikely to capture all of the variation in true
investment opportunities (Erickson and Whited (2000)). However, if one can
find a source of variation in cash flows that is uncorrelated with unobserved in-
vestment opportunities, then, even though a regression of investment on cash
flow may omit these unobservables, one can still estimate the causal effect of
cash flow on investment.

Rauh (2006) argues that the pension funding setting can identify inde-
pendent variation in cash flow. Even though pension funding status is en-
dogenously determined with investment opportunities, the rule that relates
mandatory contributions to funding status contains discontinuities and kinks.
Therefore, as long as one controls for funding status in a regression of invest-
ment on proxies for investment opportunities, and the relation between invest-
ment opportunities and funding status does not contain the same kinks and
discontinuities as the relation between mandatory contributions and funding
status, mandatory contributions are conditionally (on funding status) uncorre-
lated with investment opportunities.

This logic is analogous to the logic that provides identification in RDD, in
particular, the part that requires that the error term in the regression not have
any discontinuities at the threshold. However, this analogy does not extend to
a generic regression setting, and it is primarily in this sense that Rauh (2006)
is not an exact application of RDD.

The identification strategy in this paper is based on the idea that invest-
ment opportunities do not jump down at the point of underfunding or change
in slope at the point at which the mandatory contribution function changes
slope. Therefore, investment opportunities cannot be correlated with manda-
tory contributions, conditional on funding status. This assumption is plausible.

Figure 1. Simulated mandatory contributions. On the horizontal axis is simulated invest-
ment opportunities. Simulated funding status is a logistic function of investment opportunities,
and simulated mandatory contributions are a kinked function of funding status.

However, although these kinks and jumps clearly diminish any correlation that
might be present, they do not necessarily set it to zero. This point is easiest to
see in a more general setting. Suppose that two random variables are corre-
lated, and a third is a nonlinear function of the second. Then the claim is that
the third is necessarily uncorrelated with the first, conditional on the second.
This statement cannot be true if the conditional correlation is calculated via a
linear regression because a linear regression cannot provide perfect condition-
ing in the presence of nonlinear relationships.

We also provide a simple counter example to illustrate this point. Suppose a
random variable, y, has a standard lognormal distribution; a random variable,
x, is a logistic function of y; and a third variable, z, is zero if x > 0 but equals
0.2 + 0.4 (0.4 − x) if x < 0. This example captures the main features of the gen-
eral relation between investment opportunities, funding status, and mandatory
contributions; the relations between these variables are depicted in Figure 1.
When we simulate a sample of 5,000 observations using these assumptions,
we find that z (mandatory contributions) is correlated with y (investment op-
portunities), conditionally on x (funding status). The t-statistic is around 20.
To summarize, it is entirely possible that mandatory contributions are condi-
tionally correlated with investment opportunities and that the regressions in
Rauh (2006) do not solve the endogeneity problem. This counterexample shows
that identification strategies based on loose analogies to RDD need not be
logically correct. However, they may be empirically relevant, so we now turn to
examining this latter question.

III. Data
For our empirical analysis, we attempt to reconstruct the data set in Rauh

(2006). We start with an unbalanced panel of Compustat firms from the 2007



1092 The Journal of Finance©R

Standard and Poor’s Compustat industrial files. Definitions of the Compustat
variables we use are in the Appendix. As in Rauh (2006), we restrict our at-
tention to the subsample of Compustat firms that file an IRS 5500 form with
the Department of Labor (DOL) and that sponsor DB pension plans. We need
to impose the first restriction to calculate mandatory contributions accurately.
All pension plans over a certain size must file an IRS form 5500 yearly. We
impose the second restriction because only firms with DB pension plans must
make mandatory contributions.

Compustat provides pension data based on firm Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) filings; however, we do not use these data. As explained in
more detail in Rauh (2006), Compustat pension data are aggregated to the firm
level. They are therefore inadequate for our purposes because mandatory con-
tributions are determined at the pension plan level—not the firm level. Approx-
imately one-third of the firms in our sample have more than one pension plan,
and relying on Compustat data would therefore lead to inaccurate computation
of firms’ mandatory contributions. Furthermore, firms have significantly more
accounting discretion when submitting SEC filings than when filing form IRS
5500. SEC pension data also include both international and domestic pension
plans, whereas only domestic plans are required to pay mandatory contribu-
tions. Finally, the methods for computing pension liabilities and costs for SEC
filings are different from those that are required for computing mandatory
contributions.

The sample period runs from 1990 to 1998. The sample starts in 1990 be-
cause IRS 5500 forms are first available in standardized form from the DOL in
this year. The sample stops in 1998 because we match plans to firms primarily
by using the CUSIP of the plan’s sponsor, and in 1998 reporting requirements
no longer forced pension plans to list the CUSIP pertaining to the plan. Al-
though we match primarily by CUSIPs, missing data occasionally force us
to match by employee identification numbers (EINs) or by hand using exact
firm names. EINs and firm names only match plans that directly pertain to
the Compustat firm. For instance, if a firm’s subsidiary sponsors a plan, this
plan cannot be matched without access to the CUSIP of the parent firm. Al-
though we attempt to mitigate this problem by using subsidiary names from
the Compustat Business Information File, without the CUSIP of the parent of
the subsidiary sponsoring the plan, we face potential sample selection issues.
After this matching process, we end up with 7,905 firm-year observations, a
number somewhat smaller than that in Rauh (2006).

For each plan-year, we extract the following variables from the plan’s IRS
5500 filing: pension assets, pension liabilities, funding credits, total contribu-
tions, and normal cost, which is the present value of the pension benefits that
accrue during the current year. Pension assets are the present value of assets
in the plan at the beginning of the year. Pension liabilities are the accumulated
benefit obligation from Schedule B of the IRS 5500. From 1991 to 1994, the cal-
culation of pension liabilities follows the regulations in the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1987. After 1994, these calculations follow the regulations
in the Retirement Protection Act of 1994.



A Study of Cash Shortfalls 1093

How are mandatory contributions determined? Over the sample period from
1990 to 1998, mandatory contributions consist of two components: the mini-
mum funding contribution (MFC) and the deficit reduction contribution (DRC).
Firms must contribute the larger of the MFC or the DRC. The MFC is defined
as the sum of the normal cost and an installment payment on unfunded liabili-
ties. It is the normal cost component that provides the necessary discontinuity
at the point of underfunding. Given that some discretion is allowed in calculat-
ing this installment, we follow Munnell and Soto (2004) and Rauh (2006) and
estimate it as 10% of the funding gap. Therefore, the MFC is given by

MFC = (Normal Cost) + 0.1(Funding Gap).

The MFC can be offset by accumulated funding credits, which can be estimated
from the 5500 filings. The DRC is given as a fraction of funding status:

DRC
Funding G[ap ( ( ))]

= Pension Assets
min 0.30, 0.30−0.4 −0.6 , before 1995

[ ( (Pension Liabilities ))]
= ts

min 0.30, 0.25− Pension Asse
0.4 −0.35 , 1995 and after.

Pension Liabilities

The mandatory contribution (MPC) is then given by the following function

MPC = max [MFC, DRC],

if the funding gap is negative. The minimum and maximum in the above def-
initions create kinks in the mandatory contribution function. At these kinks,
the proportion of the funding gap that must be filled changes. As long as one
defines the threshold event as a change in this proportion, these kinks can also
be used to define threshold events.

The change to the DRC in 1995 was also accompanied by two provisions
that created further discontinuities in the mandatory contribution function.
First, plans that were at least 90% funded were exempt from the DRC, and
second, plans that were at least 80% funded and that had a recent history
of being overfunded were also exempt. These thresholds imply actual discon-
tinuities because at these thresholds the DRC can be much larger than the
MFC.

In this setting, two natural definitions of the funding gap arise. In either case,
for a firm with one plan, defining the funding gap is straightforward. However,
defining a funding gap for a firm with multiple plans is more complicated. One
alternative, from Rauh (2006), is to sum the gaps across all pension plans within
a firm. This definition, which we refer to as the average funding status, correctly
identifies the zero underfunding point only if firms can easily shift funds across
plans. Another alternative is to define the funding gap as the smallest gap if
all plans have positive funding status, and as the sum of the negative gaps if



1094 The Journal of Finance©R

any plans have negative funding status. This definition captures the notion of
the distance to the point of violation if firms cannot shift funds across plans.
As we show below, the use of one definition or another is immaterial for our
full-sample regressions.

IV. Full-Sample Analysis
We first examine the entire spectrum of funding statuses to pinpoint exactly

which kinks and jumps in the mandatory contribution function are likely to
provide a causal effect on investment. Here, we use both informal visual and
formal statistical analysis and pay close attention to the characteristics of the
firms at different points along the function.

A. Visual Analysis
Panel A of Figure 2 plots a kernel regression of the ratio of investment to as-

sets on average funding status, where the latter is scaled by pension liabilities
for ease of interpretation. The relevant vertical axis is on the left. The solid line
is the fitted regression line, and the dotted lines are 5% confidence bands. This
regression closely replicates the result in Rauh (2006) that investment appears
to drop off sharply after the point at which pension assets equal pension liabili-
ties. However, the kernel regression does not tell the whole story. The solid line
plots a histogram of the funding status, superimposed on the kernel regression,
with the vertical axis on the right indicating the number of observations. The
drop in investment does not occur until underfunding is between 10% and 15%
of pension liabilities, but the histogram indicates that few observations in the
sample can be found at or below this point. Indeed, the tenth percentile is at
the 12% level of underfunding, and the fifth percentile is at the 22% level of
underfunding.

This finding highlights one of the most important concerns facing studies that
emphasize identification of causal effects: internal versus external validity. The
figure suggests informally that although pension funding problems may indeed
cause drops in investment, if this causal effect exists it is likely limited to a few
firms. Providing more definitive evidence on this conjecture is our next task.

As a first step, we continue with our informal visual analysis to determine
whether there are any causal effects around the point of zero underfunding,
where a reasonably large part of the sample lies. Panel B of Figure 2 plots
two kernel regressions of investment on the funding gap, one using only ob-
servations with a positive gap, and the other using only observations with a
negative gap. This type of informal analysis is recommended in Imbens and
Lemieux (2008), who comment that formal statistical analysis is essentially
just a sophisticated version of this sort of basic plot. The intent is to find a
discontinuity in the outcome of interest, which in our case is investment. If no
discontinuity can be observed, there is little chance that formal analysis will
lead to estimates with economically and statistically significant magnitudes.
We find that the two regression lines almost meet at the discontinuity point

sample of firms from Compustat from 1990 to 1998. Both panels plot the univariate relation be-
tween investment (vertical axis) and funding status (horizontal axis). Superimposed on these plots
is a histogram of funding status. Funding status is defined as the sum of the plan surpluses minus
the sum of the plan deficits. The kernel regression estimation is performed using an Epanech-
nikov kernel, with a bandwidth of 0.1. In Panel A, one regression is done for the full sample. In
Panel B, separate regressions are performed for positive and negative funding statuses. Dotted

corresponding to a zero funding gap. Further, their difference lies well inside
the 5% confidence bands, that is, there is no evidence of a significant jump in
investment at the threshold. The zero underfunding point is, hence, unlikely
to be providing identification.3

are in the Internet Appendix for this article, which is available online in the “Supplements and
Datasets” section at http://www.afajof.org/supplements.asp.

This result begs the question of whether one can find significant results by
performing analogous tests using the other kinks and discontinuities in the
pension funding function. The answer is no. Although we do observe small
differences in investment for observations to the left and right of the 90%
threshold, the 80% threshold, and the kink point at which the DRC equals
the MFC,4 none of these differences are significantly different from zero.5 This
last result needs to be interpreted with caution, however, because the lack
of significance is likely due to the paucity of observations near these three
thresholds.

In sum, Figure 2 illustrates a useful diagnostic to employ whenever one is
trying to use a threshold event to obtain identification. The main intent is to
find at the threshold an effect that is both statistically significant and visually
large enough that economic significance is not an issue. The secondary intent
is to determine what fraction of the sample lies at any discontinuity points.

B. Regression Analysis
Table I examines the effects of funding thresholds on investment in a regres-

sion framework. First, we replicate the results in Rauh (2006) by estimating
his central regression:

Iit = C MC
a Q i

A i + at + F
b1 i,t−1 + t + FS

b b it
2 3 + b it

4 + uit, (9)
i,t−1 Ai,t−1 Ai,t−1 Ai,t−1

where Iit is capital expenditures for firm i at time t, Ai,t−1 is beginning-of-
period book assets, Qi,t−1 is the beginning-of-period market-to-book ratio, CFit
is nonpension cash flow, MCit is the mandatory contribution, and FSit is the
average funding status of all plans in a firm. All of these regressions contain
fixed firm and year effects, ai and at, and the standard errors are robust to
heteroskedasticity and clustering at the firm level. Before turning to the re-
sults, it is important to note that (9) is not an exact application of regression
discontinuity because it does not contain a funding violation indicator or indi-
cators for whether the firm is past the 80% or 90% funding thresholds or the
kink point defined by MFC = DRC. Instead, it contains mandatory contribu-
tions because of the economic question involved, which is not whether funding
violations themselves affect investment, but whether internal resources affect
investment.6

The first two columns of Table I present estimates of (9) using two different
measures of the distance to a funding violation: average funding status (in
column 1) and the funding gap (in column 2). As in much of the investment

4 For a firm with one pension plan, calculating this kink point is straightforward. For those with
multiple plans, we calculate the kink using the pension plan for which the kink is closest to the
zero funding point.

5 These figures are contained in the Internet Appendix.
6 Nonetheless, it is straightforward to gauge the magnitude of the coefficient on mandatory

contributions in terms of the absolute drop in investment by multiplying the coefficient by the
average mandatory contribution for payers.

Estimates are from a sample of unregulated and nonfinancial firms from the 2007 Compustat
annual industrial files. The sample period is 1990 to 1998. Pension data are from IRS Form 5500.
MPCs are mandatory pension contributions to underfunded plans, scaled by total assets. Funding
Status is the average across plans of pension assets minus pension liabilities, as a fraction of total
assets. Funding Gap is the smallest funding gap if all plans have positive gaps, and the sum of the
negative gaps if any plans have negative gaps. Nonpension Cash Flow is income plus depreciation
plus pension expense, all scaled by total assets. Violation Indicator is a dummy variable for whether
the variable “Funding Gap” is positive or negative. Distances to 80% and 90% underfunding and
the corresponding indicator variables are defined analogously. Kink is the point at which the
MFC equals the DRC. All regressions contain fixed firm and year effects. Standard errors are in
parentheses and are corrected for heteroskedasticity and clustering at the firm level.

literature, we find a small but statistically significant coefficient on Qi,t−1 and a
larger, significant coefficient on CFit/Ai,t−1. For both measures of distance, the
coefficient on mandatory contributions is negative and significant. The results
using average funding status are almost identical to those in Rauh (2006),
although our coefficient on mandatory contributions is somewhat smaller than
in that study.

Figure 2 indicates that the relation between investment and funding sta-
tus (and hence mandatory contributions) is nonlinear, and that the steepest
portion of this relation may be confined to a small group of underfunded firms.
As a first pass in examining this possibility, we include threshold dummies in
the regression instead of mandatory contributions. We consider four thresholds:



1098 The Journal of Finance©R

zero underfunding, 90% funding, 80% funding, and the kink point at which
DRC = MFC. In each of these regressions, we follow the RDD literature and
estimate variants of (8) that include the distance to the relevant threshold
point. Interestingly, only the coefficient on the 90% funding threshold is signif-
icantly negative. This finding is in accord with the evidence in Figure 2 that
the large drop in investment happens for firms that are less than 90% funded.

Table II fleshes out this point in a different way by looking at subsamples
defined by funding status. For brevity, we leave analysis of the kink point to the
Internet Appendix because we find no economically or statistically significant
results. This pattern makes sense in that defining an event as a change in slope
is unlikely to provide much in the way of significant results inasmuch as the
event itself is small.

The first column of Table II repeats the full-sample regression of invest-
ment on the market-to-book ratio, cash flow, the funding gap, and mandatory
contributions, which is from column 2 in Table I. The next several columns
examine the robustness of the coefficient on mandatory contributions to run-
ning this regression on different subsamples defined by funding status. This
type of exercise is useful for understanding exactly where identification comes
from when threshold events are involved. The second column shows that, when
one drops the 12% of the sample that is less than 90% funded, the coefficient
on mandatory contributions drops slightly and the significance disappears. In
contrast, column 3 shows that, when one drops the 6% of the sample that is less
than 80% funded, the coefficient on mandatory contributions increases slightly
and becomes more significant.

This result suggests that it is the observations that are 80% to 90% funded
that are driving most of the results. This conjecture is supported by the results
in the fourth column, which correspond to a sample that omits the observa-
tions in the 80% to 90% funding interval. Here, the coefficient on mandatory
contributions is insignificantly different from zero. The next four columns ex-
amine samples containing (i) all underfunded firms, (ii) firms less than 90%
funded, (iii) firms less than 80% funded, and (iv) firms between 80% and 90%
funded. In none of these regressions is the coefficient on mandatory contribu-
tions significantly different from zero. Especially interesting is the result for the
firms that are between 80% and 90% funded. The contrast between columns
2 and 3 suggests that these firms are driving the result of a significant re-
sponse of investment to mandatory contributions, yet an examination of these
firms alone reveals no effect at all. One possible explanation is that it is the
contrast between the treated (heavily underfunded) and not-treated (over-
funded) firms that is driving the significant coefficient on mandatory contri-
butions. We consider this possibility below when we examine sample summary
statistics.

First, we use a complementary method to pinpoint the source of the iden-
tifying data variation. We run regression (9) using a kernel estimator in
which the smoothing is done over the gap between pension assets and pension
liabilities, scaled by pension liabilities. The results are depicted in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Kernel regression of investment on mandatory contributions. Calculations are
based on a sample of firms from Compustat from 1990 to 1998. The regression estimated is the
ratio of investment to assets on the market-to-book ratio, the ratio of cash flow to assets, the ratio
of mandatory contributions to assets, and the distance to the point of zero underfunding. The
smoothing is done over the gap between pension assets and liabilities, with this difference scaled
by pension liabilities. A Gaussian kernel with a cross-validated bandwidth of 0.065 is used. The
dotted lines indicate 5% confidence bands calculated with nonclustered standard errors. The results
indicate a small, significant effect on investment for firms between 10% and 25% underfunded.

bands using nonclustered standard errors. Here, we see that most of the sig-
nificant negative reaction of investment to mandatory contributions occurs for
firms that are between 8% and 27% underfunded.7 Because mandatory contri-
butions are largest in this range, this piece of evidence underscores one of the
main econometric messages of the paper: threshold events are likely to reveal
causal effects when the events themselves are large.

This evidence is somewhat weak, however, in that the statistical significance
of the results disappears with the use of clustered standard errors. Nonetheless,
it does confirm the basic finding that the impact of mandatory contributions on
investment is confined to about 5% of the observations in the sample.

C. Summary Statistics
Whether the association between mandatory contributions and investment

is causal depends on whether the observations that are associated with the
decline in investment are comparable to those in the rest of the sample. In gen-
eral, it is important to examine whether treated firms (with large mandatory
contributions) are different from the control group of untreated firms (with
small or zero mandatory contributions), as it is possible that those charac-
teristics that drive firms to be underfunded also drive investment. Table III

7 The strong positive response for extremely underfunded firms is the product of a few outliers
with very high investment.

Summary Statistics

The figures presented are means from a sample of unregulated and nonfinancial firms from the
2007 Compustat annual industrial files. The sample period is 1990 to 1998. Pension data are from
IRS Form 5500. Mandatory Contributions are federally mandated contributions to a pension plan
with assets less than liabilities. Total Contributions are mandatory plus voluntary contributions.
Plan Violation Indicator equals one if the firm is making mandatory pension contributions, and
zero otherwise. “In Violation” indicates that the Plan Violation Indicator is one. Average Funding
Status is the average across plans of pension assets minus pension liabilities, as a fraction of total
firm assets. Average Funding Status Indicator is one if average funding status is positive, and zero
otherwise. Funding Gap is the smallest funding surplus if all plans are running surpluses, and the
sum of the deficits if any plans are running deficits. Bond Rating is a dummy variable that takes a
value of one if a firm has an S&P long-term bond rating, and zero otherwise. All variables except
employment are deflated by total book assets.

presents several summary statistics for our sample of firms, with each column
containing figures for a particular subsample. All of the variables are scaled by
firm assets, except employment, which is measured in logs.

Before examining different subsamples near the different discontinuity
points, to provide context we first examine the full sample. Average firm size is



1102 The Journal of Finance©R

quite large. For example, the mean value of assets for all firms in Compustat
between 1990 and 1998 is 1,670 million dollars, whereas the mean for this
sample is 3,447 million dollars. This result is not surprising in that older, more
mature firms tend to be those with DB pension plans. The large average size
of the firms in this sample is also evident in the high incidence of firms that
have bond ratings relative to the rest of the Compustat universe. A final im-
portant pattern to notice is the small size of mandatory contributions relative
to investment: the latter is on average over 40 times larger than the former.

The next two columns of the table investigate the differences between the
firms with positive and negative pension gaps. These two groups of firms are
surprisingly similar, except along a few dimensions. The firms that are not in
violation have slightly higher levels of Tobin’s q, invest slightly more, and have
slightly higher cash flow. One figure that immediately stands out in the third
line of the table is that only 62% of the firms classified as having all plans in
the black also have positive average funding status. To the extent that different
plans are not fungible, this finding means that average funding status is not a
good indicator of the point of zero underfunding status.

The fourth column examines firms that are less than 90% funded, where
the level of funding is measured by the pension gap. (As demonstrated in the
Internet Appendix, nearly identical results are produced by average funding
status.) This group is systematically different from the rest of the sample. Not
only do these firms invest less, but they have lower values of Tobin’s q, and they
have cash flow that is about three-fourths that of the sample average. Further,
they are two-thirds as large as the average firm, they pay half the dividends
that the average firm pays, and they are much less likely to have a bond rating.
More strikingly, they have less than one-third the earnings of their overfunded
counterparts, their Altman’s Z-scores are just over half the average Z-score in
the rest of the sample, and they are shrinking their workforces at a rate of over
1.7% per year. Although these firms do not appear to be in extreme financial
distress, they are markedly worse off along a number of dimensions than the
firms in the rest of the sample. The fifth column shows summary statistics for
the firms that are less than 80% funded. This group closely resembles those
that are less than 90% funded but are in more serious distress.

Why are these differences in observable characteristics important? They hint
at potentially large differences in unobservables, and they lend credence to the
hypothesis that over the whole sample these differences have as much a role
to play in the determination of investment as do mandatory contributions.
The two characteristics that are particularly interesting along this line are
size and the incidence of bond ratings. Both characteristics have long been
used as indicators of access to external capital markets. Therefore, it is hard to
rule out the possibility that financial constraints cause both the underfunding
of the pension plans and the investment declines. So even though financial
constraints may be affecting the investment of these firms, it is hard to argue
that mandatory contributions themselves cause investment declines. It is also
hard to argue that financial constraints manifest themselves as a sensitivity of
investment to cash flow shortfall.

Funding Gap

Figure 4. Funding gap density. Calculations are based on a sample of firms from Compustat
from 1990 to 1998. The pension gap is defined as the minimum plan surplus if all of the plans in a
firm have a surplus and as the sum of the deficits if at least one of a firm’s plans has a deficit. This
figure depicts a histogram of funding gaps as a fraction of total pension liabilities.

Of course, it is rarely possible to test exact identifying assumptions that lead
to causal inference. What is possible is a variety of robustness checks that
can either lend credence to or question an identification strategy. For exam-
ple, when using threshold events to obtain identification, it is important to
understand exactly what parts of the sample are providing identification and
to understand any systematic difference between these observations and the
rest of the sample. The reason is the classic trade-off between internal and
external validity. If the parts of the sample that provide identification are sys-
tematically different from the rest of the sample, then it is difficult to argue
for causality or extrapolate any results obtained from one part of the sam-
ple to the rest of the sample.8 Although these robustness checks can never
be definitive in a strict statistical sense, they can often be informative and
useful.

V. Local-Sample Analysis
At this point we have several pieces of evidence that make it hard to in-

fer that the correlation between mandatory contributions and investment is
causal. We can go further, however, given that funding violations are thresh-
old events. In particular, we can use RDD to examine what happens at these
points.

8 A useful counter example is in Babenko, Lemmon, and Tserlukevich (2011), who use the
exercise of executive options as a threshold event to examine the sensitivity of investment to
exogenous sources of cash flow. Because exercise thresholds differ widely across firms, they are
less likely to be highly correlated with either financing constraints or investment opportunities.

First, we examine the density of the selection variable (the funding gap)
around the points of zero underfunding, 90% funding, and 80% funding.9 The
intent is to determine whether there is a discontinuity in its density. If there
is such a discontinuity, firms might be manipulating the funding gap, thus
invalidating the RDD design. It is important to note here that a continuous
density does not imply that funding status is exogenous. Instead, it only implies
that RDD can be used to obtain causal inference in the face of an endogenous
funding status.

Figure 4 plots a histogram of the ratio of the funding gap to pension liabilities,
with a bin width of 0.002. We observe a great deal of clustering around the zero
underfunding point, but no bunching of observations on one side or the other.
Two explanations are possible for the clustering. First, firms lose tax benefits
from contributing to their plans if the plans are too overfunded. This provision
gives them an incentive not to build too much of a cushion against a possible
funding shortfall. Second, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation insures
the pension plans, which gives firms less of an incentive to overfund. One
does nonetheless wonder why firms do not crowd just above the cutoff point if
they can indeed manipulate the pension gap. Two explanations are possible.
First, they might not care about making a mandatory contribution if they make
regular contributions in the first place or if the consequences for being barely
underfunded are small. Second, even if the firms do care about being above the
gap, random fluctuations in the value of pension assets can undo their attempts
to avoid a funding violation. Both cases support the idea that the location of
firms close to one side or the other is approximately random. In contrast to the
case of the zero underfunding point, we observe neither clustering nor bunching
around the 80% and 90% funding points. In sum, all of this evidence is exactly
what is needed to use threshold events as identification strategies.

Our next step is to estimate an average treatment effect of these thresholds
on a variety of real and financial variables. The definition in (4) provides no
guidance for picking a sample that is “close” to the funding violation threshold.
We therefore follow Hoxby (2000), who starts with a tiny sample size and then
examines the results when the sample size is increased. This strategy allows
us to demonstrate the extent to which our results are sensitive to the window
width that defines a small sample. We estimate the treatment effect by regress-
ing a variable of interest on a dummy for negative funding status and fixed
firm and year effects.10 We consider 17 variables: mandatory contributions,
sales of capital goods, investment, R&D, advertising, leverage, short-term debt
issuance, total debt issuance, the change in cash, the level of cash, dividends,

9 We omit the kink point for brevity, given no evidence of significant causal effects.
10 As shown in Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw (2001), a simple difference in means between

firms on either side of the threshold can have more asymptotic bias than a local linear regression of
the variable of interest on a violation indicator and the distance to the point of violation. However,
in a local sample this second method can introduce collinearity between the threshold dummy
and the distance to the threshold. We have also estimated a treatment effect using a local linear
regression, with the main difference being less evidence of an effect on inventories. See the Internet
Appendix for details.

Figure 5. Local responses to funding violations. Calculations are based on a sample of firms
from Compustat from 1990 to 1998. Each panel in this figure plots regression coefficients from
40 regressions as a function of the sample used for the estimation. Each panel is labeled by the
dependent variable in the regression. The regressors are a pension violation indicator and firm and
time fixed effects, and the coefficient of interest is that on the violation indicator. On the horizontal
axis is a measure of the sample used for estimation, which is the absolute value of the pension gap
as a fraction of plan assets. The pension gap is defined as the minimum plan surplus if all of the
plans in a firm have a surplus and as the sum of the deficits if at least one of a firm’s plans has a
deficit. The sample used for the calculation is all observations for which the absolute value of the
pension gaps is less than the specified value on the horizontal axis. All dependent variables except
employment are expressed as a fraction of total assets. Employment is measured as the natural
log of millions of employees.

the change in employment, and the level of employment. All variables except
for employment are measured as a fraction of total book assets. Employment
is measured as the log of total employees. We only report results for manda-
tory contributions, investment, and the significant results for any of the rest of
these variables. All results for the other variables are contained in the Internet
Appendix.

The results for the point of zero underfunding are presented in Figure 5.

from Compustat from 1990 to 1998. Each panel in this figure plots regression coefficients from
40 regressions as a function of the sample used for the estimation. Each panel is labeled by the
dependent variable in the regression. The regressors are an indicator for whether any firm pension
plan is at least 90% underfunded and firm and time fixed effects, and the coefficient of interest
is that on the underfunding indicator. On the horizontal axis is a measure of the sample used

measures the within-firm difference in the dependent variable between obser-
vations just to the left and just to the right of the cutoff. The distance from
a zero funding gap is on the horizontal axis, with the distance measured as a
fraction of pension liabilities. Larger values for the gap correspond to larger
sample sizes. For example, a gap of 0.002 corresponds to a sample size of 406,

and a gap of 0.04 corresponds to a sample size of 2,180. The solid line repre-
sents the coefficient estimate as a function of the distance to the threshold.
The dashed lines are 5% confidence bands calculated using clustered standard
errors.

The first panel shows the response of mandatory contributions. We calcu-
late this response for two reasons. First, we know, a priori, that there is a
causal response of mandatory contributions to funding thresholds. If local re-
gressions cannot pick up this effect, then there is little hope that they have
sufficient power to pick up other effects. Fortunately, this is not the case.
We find a statistically significant difference between the near violators and
near escapees even for the smallest gaps. The second reason for calculat-
ing the response of mandatory contributions is to gauge the magnitude of
the responses of the other variables. It is worth noting that the response of
mandatory contributions is quite small—between 0.02% and 0.1% of total firm
assets.

In contrast, the response of investment is statistically insignificant from zero.
The next four panels show that we find significant coefficients on the violation
dummy variable in the regressions for R&D, inventories, receivables, and the
change in employment. What is striking about these results, however, is not
that they are significant but rather that the magnitude of the response is much
larger than the magnitude of the rise in mandatory contributions. This finding
is interesting because it brings up the important point of concurrent unobserv-
able treatments. The only way that tiny mandatory contributions can “cause”
large changes in firm policies is via expectations about the future. If managers
perceive current violations as signals of many years of funding difficulties, they
may cut back in large ways today to avoid these problems. However, absent a
dynamic model of the firm, it is only possible to conjecture about such an effect.
One other possibility that can explain the relatively large responses of these
variables is a discontinuous concurrent change in some other variable that
affects managerial decisions. To explore this possibility, we calculate similar
response functions for cash flow and the market-to-book ratio. As documented
in the Internet Appendix, we find an insignificant response of market-to-book
but a strong and significant response of cash flow. Of course, the natural thing
to do is to rerun the local regressions conditioning on cash flow. Even in this
case, however, we find similar magnitudes and levels of significance. See the
Internet Appendix for details. In sum, although it is possible that mandatory
contributions cause significant changes in both real and financial variables, it
is also likely that something else is going on at this point, given the relative
magnitudes of firm choice variables and mandatory contributions.

Figure 6 contains analogous results corresponding to the 90% funding point.
In this case, it is possible to exploit the 1995 change in the laws to exempt from
the DRCs plans that were at least 90% funded. Figure 6 is therefore different
from Figure 5 in that the dummy variable used in the local regressions is
interacted with a dummy that equals one if the year is greater than 1994.
Once again, we find an insignificant response of investment, but significant
responses of mandatory contributions, receivables, inventories, and changes

Figure 7. Local responses to 20% underfunding. Calculations are based on a sample of firms
from Compustat from 1990 to 1998. Each panel in this figure plots regression coefficients from
40 regressions as a function of the sample used for the estimation. Each panel is labeled by the
dependent variable in the regression. The regressors are an indicator for whether any firm pension
plan is at least 80% underfunded and firm and time fixed effects, and the coefficient of interest
is that on the underfunding indicator. On the horizontal axis is a measure of the sample used
for estimation, which is the absolute value of the distance from the point of 80% underfunding,
measured as a fraction of pension liabilities. All dependent variables except employment are
expressed as a fraction of total assets. Employment is measured as the natural log of millions of
employees.

in employment. For the 90% threshold, we also find significant responses of
equity issuance and working capital investment. As in the case of the point of
zero underfunding, the responses of firm policies are larger in magnitude than
the responses of mandatory contributions. Interestingly, we find no responses
of any variables except mandatory contributions when we interact the 90%
funding dummy with a dummy that equals one if the year is before 1995. This
type of placebo test is an important part of any study that uses threshold events
to identify causal effects.

Finally, Figure 7 contains analogous results corresponding to the 80% fund-
ing point. As in the case of the 90% threshold, we interact the threshold dummy
with a post-1995 dummy. In this case, we find no responses of real variables.
Only cash, receivables, and working capital investment produce significant



A Study of Cash Shortfalls 1109

effects. Our pre-1995 placebo tests yield no significant responses. We take these
results with a grain of salt, however, given that there are very few observations
near the 80% funding point.

VI. Conclusion
This paper seeks to understand how firms react to quasi-exogenous threshold

events in which something happens when an observable continuous variable
passes a threshold. It also seeks to clarify how to use threshold events to ob-
tain identification of causal effects in corporate finance applications. We frame
our discussion around the evidence in Rauh (2006) that firms cut investment
sharply in response to mandatory contributions to their pension funds. This
example is particularly instructive because of the rich institutional detail char-
acterizing pension funding.

From examining our entire sample of firms with DB pension plans, we find
that, although we can replicate the result of a strong negative correlation
between mandatory contributions and investment, we also find that this corre-
lation stems from firm-year observations in which pension plans are seriously
underfunded. Further, these observations constitute a small fraction of the to-
tal sample, and they are systematically different from the rest of the sample in
terms of several observable characteristics.

We also use local linear regression techniques from the RDD literature to
ascertain whether discontinuities in the function relating mandatory contri-
butions to pension funding can be used to isolate causal effects. Here, we find
robust evidence of causal effects on both accounts receivable management and
hiring. We also find less robust effects on other components of working capital
and on R&D. The interesting economic takeaway from all of these results is
that the link between real economic activity and finance likely extends beyond
the heavily studied link between finance and investment. Other real decisions,
especially employment decisions, are likely to be just as important. This ev-
idence is supported by the result in Campello, Graham, and Harvey (2010)
that firms planned to cut employment and other variables during the financial
crisis.

What econometric takeaways have we gleaned from examining pension fund-
ing? This setting is ideal for understanding how to use threshold events to
identify causal effects because it is not an exact application of RDD. It is there-
fore possible to understand the extent to which the intuition from RDD can
be extended to broader circumstances. We conclude that using the reasoning
behind RDD loosely in a general regression setting can lead to misleading
inferences. Although a threshold rule such as a pension violation can provide
strong local identification of a causal effect, this identification is likely to dis-
appear as one moves away from the threshold. The lesson we take away from
this example is that researchers who use these types of analogies to RDD need
to examine their data carefully to determine exactly where their identification
comes from. If this identifying data variation is isolated, as is the case here, it
is important to determine whether this part of the sample is different from the



1110 The Journal of Finance©R

rest of the sample. Otherwise, the strong internal validity one can obtain from
examining threshold events has little if any broader external validity. A greater
concern is that the results obtained from any discontinuities may actually be
the direct product of any differences between those observations affected by
the discontinuity and those not affected. In the current case, this concern is
real inasmuch as the differences are strongly related to indicators of financial
constraints.

Finally, we illustrate how to use RDD around points of discontinuity. We
emphasize understanding firm incentives to locate either near or far from any
discontinuities. We also emphasize checking relative magnitudes of responses
to causal events and using placebo tests to validate any findings. These checks
are essential to help rule out the possibility of concurrent unobserved events
around the discontinuity points.

In conclusion, threshold events occur frequently in corporate finance because
of the rich accounting and regulatory framework in the field. We therefore
suspect that their use in formulating identification strategies is likely to grow,
and we hope that this study provides a useful template for studying threshold
events.

Appendix
Our data for our pension application come from the 2007 Compustat in-

dustrial files. We define book assets as item 6, cash as item 1, inventories
as item 3, working capital as item 4 minus item 5, capital expenditures as
item 128, dividends as the sum of items 19 and 21, long-term debt as item
9, short-term debt as item 34 plus item 44, the number of common shares as
item 25, the share price as item 199, balance sheet deferred taxes as item
74, equity issuance as item 108, employment as item 29, the book value
of common equity as item 60, and share repurchases as item 115. As in
Rauh (2006), we define nonpension cash flow as the sum of items 14, 18,
and 43, and cash flow as nonpension cash flow minus total pension contri-
butions from IRS form 5500. The numerator of the market-to-book ratio is
book assets minus the book value of common equity minus deferred taxes
plus the product of the share price and the number of shares outstand-
ing. The denominator is total book assets. A bond rating is the S&P long-
term domestic issuer credit rating (S(PDRC). Altman’s Z-score is defined as
1.2 ((item 4 − item 5) /item 6) + ) ( )

1.4 item 36/item 6 (+ 3.3 item 13/item 6 +
0.6 ((item 25 × item 199) / (item 9 + item 34)) + )

0.999 item 12/ item 6 .
