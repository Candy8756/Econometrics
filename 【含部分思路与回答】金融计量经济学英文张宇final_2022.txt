计量考卷：去年（2024年）和这套卷子（2022年）的区别是就删了一道题。

里面的答案不一定对，因为是当时学长和学姐在做的过程中打印出来写的，具体答案还需要
让ds和豆包辩论得出。

今年是不是还一样的试卷只能祈祷

Final Exam of Financial Econometrics, Fall 2022 
December 26, 2022 

8:30-10:30 am 
Total Points: 120 

 
 
 
1. (8 points, 2 points each)  

For each of the following R codes, describe what the code is trying to do, and write down the 
output:  
 

 
 
a) C[1,] 

 
 
 

b) C[c(1,2),c(1,3)] 
 
 
 

c) C[year>=2019] 
 
 
 

d) library(dplyr) 
(C %>% select(year, stkprc2) %>% filter(year<2018))  
 
 
 

  



2. (9 points, 3 points each) Write R codes to perform the tasks required. 

 

 
a) Using D and E, assemble a new data frame F.  

F should have three variables: year, stkprc1 and stkprc2.  
F should have 5 rows, corresponding to year 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020.  
Your code should take only one line.  
Just write down the code. No need to write down the output. 
 
 
 
 

b) Using D and the ggplot2 package, draw a scatter plot of stkprc1 (y) on year (x) with a 
linear regression line and the associated confidence intervals of the linear regression.  
Just write down the code. No need to draw the figure yourself.  
 
 
 

c) Using C and the ggplot2 package, draw a line plot of stkprc1 (y1) and stkprc2 (y2) on 
year (x).  
Just write down the code. No need to draw the figure yourself. 
 
 
 
 

  



3. (6 points) You are studying the relationship between a firm’s return on equity (ROE) and CEO 
salary. In the dataset ceosal, you find that the average salary of a CEO (salary) is 1,281 thousand 
USD, and the average ROE of a firm (roe) is 17.18%. The covariance between salary and roe 
is 1342.54. The standard deviation of salary is 1,372 thousand USD, and the standard deviation 
of roe is 8.52%. The regression equation is: 

 
salary_i = b0 + b1 * roe_i + u_i 

 
What is the OLS estimate of b1? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

  



4. (5 points) In the linear regression model, we have defined the total sum of squares (TSS), the 
explained sum of squares (SSE), and the residual sum of squares (SSR). They are calculated 
as follows: 
 

𝑛𝑛 𝑛𝑛 𝑛𝑛

𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 = �(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦�)2 , 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑆𝑆 = �( 𝑦𝑦�𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦�)2 , 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑆𝑆 = �𝑢𝑢�2𝑖𝑖  
𝑖𝑖=1 𝑖𝑖=1 𝑖𝑖=1

where  𝑦𝑦�𝑖𝑖 = 𝑏𝑏0 +  𝑏𝑏�1𝑥𝑥1𝑖𝑖 + ⋯+ + 𝑏𝑏�𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 and 𝑢𝑢�𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦�𝑖𝑖. 
 
Question: Which of the following is the R-squared? 
 

(A) �SSE
2

�          (B) �SSE�        (C) �SSE�        (D) 1 − �SSE� 
SSR SSR TSS TSS

 
 
 
 

  



5. (5 points, 1 point each) True or False (binscatter)

A) The code generates a scatter plot of salary (y) on roe (x) using the ceosal1 dataset. 
B) The code generates a scatter plot of grouped averages of salary (y) on roe (x) using the 
ceosal1 dataset. 
C) The figure indicates that the homotheticity assumption likely does not hold. 
D) The figure indicates that the relationship between salary and roe may not be as simple as a 
linear relationship. 
E) The binscatter graph is a helpful tool, but it is not useful for exploring the relationship 
between y and x when y contains measurement errors.  

  



6. (9 points, 3 point each) Interpret the regression results in the following table. The dependent 
variable is the logarithm of the salary of a firm’s CEO, and the independent variable is the 
firm’s return on equity (ROE).

a) Everything else equal, how does the wage of a single male compare to the wage of a 

married female? 
 
 
 
 
 
 

b) For a worker with 10 years of work experience, what is the expected effect of an 
additional year of work experience on her wage?  
 
(Hint: the answer is slightly different if you use an exact calculation or if you take the 
derivative. Both answers will be correct.) 

 
 
  



9. (10 points, 2 points each) True or False (Binary choice models) 
a) After estimating the linear probability model, you should compute the marginal effect. 
b) After estimating the logit model or the probit model, you should compute the marginal 
effect. 
c) The marginal effect of an x variable measures the average increase in Prob(Y=1) when that 
x variable increases by one.  
d) After estimating a logit or a probit model, you should check the predicted value of the 
regression to see whether the predicted values are mostly between 0 and 1. 
e) The logit model and the probit model are better than the linear probability model because 
the effect on Prob(Y=1) when the value of a dummy variable increases from 0 to 1 is more 
stable under the logit model and the probit model.  
 
 
 
 
 
 

  



10. (6 points) Measurement errors in the x variable: Suppose the true model that generates y and x 
is as follows: 

yi = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 
 

However, you do not observe the true value 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖. Instead, you observe 𝑥𝑥∗𝑖𝑖 = 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖, where 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 
is the measurement error in the x variable.  
 
Thus, when you estimate the regression model, you are in fact estimating the following 
model with measurement error in the x variable: 

 
y ∗
i = 𝑏𝑏0 + 𝑏𝑏1𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 

 
 Question: What is the relationship between  𝑏𝑏�1 (the estimated regression coefficient of y on  

x* when there are measurement errors in the x variable) and 𝛽𝛽 (the true regression  
coefficient)?  
 
Describe the steps you took to get to the answer.  

  



11. (8 points, 2 points each) True or False (Tobit and Heckman selection) 
a) The OLS is not valid when the data is MCAR.  
b) The Tobit model is designed to handle situations where you observe a censored version of 
the true dependent variable. For example, the true dependent variable is y and you observe 
only y* = max(0,y). If you would like to know the effect of x on y, you should compute the 
marginal effect after estimating the Tobit model. 
c) The Heckman selection model is designed to handle situations where selection into the 
sample may depend on some unobserved benefit, so that an estimation based on the OLS will 
suffer from an omitted variable bias. The Heckman selection model includes the Inverse Mills 
ratio from the second stage estimation as an additional control variable in the first stage 
regression to address this omitted variable bias concern.  
d) You can use exactly the same set of x variables in the first stage and the second stage of the 
Heckman selection model.  

 
 
 

  



12. (9 points, 3 points each) The instrumental variable approach can be described as follows. You 
are studying the relationship between y and x: 

yi = b0 + b1xi + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖  
but xi and ui are not independent, which violates the OLS assumptions and biases the 
estimated coefficient b�1.  
 
For example, yi is a firm’s innovation activities (e.g. number of new products developed), and 
xi is the amount of VC investment the firm receives; in this case, ui can include many factors 
that affects the firm’s yi beyond VC investment that it received.  

 
a) Suppose whether the firm’s founder graduated from a top 2 university positively attracts 

VC investment and positively affects innovation activities. How will this affect the 
correlation between  xi and  ui, and how will this affect the estimated coefficient b�1? 
 

b) The instrumental variable approach uses an instrumental variable zi, and involves 
estimating a first stage regression, computing the predicted value x�i, and use the 
predicted value in the original regression: 

𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = a0 + a1zi + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 
yi = b0 + b1x�i + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖  

What are the names and the contents of the two assumptions required in order for the 
instrumental variable zi to be valid?  
 

c) Based on these two assumptions, evaluate whether the number of VC funds in the firm’s 
headquarter city is a valid instrument for the above example. Explain why.  

  



13. (7 points) Write down the regression equation for the following regression discontinuity plot.  
 
The name of the y variable is SOEInvestment (vertical axis), i.e. equity investment the firm 
received from state-owned investors.  
 
The horizontal axis is a firm’s score in the Innofund (科技部创新基金) grant evaluation 
process.  
 
When Score>=0, the firm successfully gets the grant and certification from the Innofund.  
 
Specify which regression coefficient is the coefficient of interest in the regression equation 
you write down.  

 
  



14. (14 points, 2 points each) True or False (Time series and panel data) 
a) You can control for seasonality in a time series regression with monthly data by 

including month of the year dummies (Jan, Feb, …) as control variables.  
b) The unit root test uses a regression based on the AR(1) model: 

yt = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜌𝜌𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 
If you cannot reject the null hypothesis 𝜌𝜌 = 0, then yt has a unit root.  

c) When yt has a unit root, Δyt = yt − yt−1 will NOT have a unit root.  
d) HAC standard errors can deal with regression errors that are correlated over time.  
e) Clustered standard errors can deal with regression errors that are correlated over time, 

but can only be used with panel data.  
f) With panel data, you can control for unobservable characteristics that are time-invariant 

using individual fixed effects. Then, the regression coefficient measures the effect of the 
x variable, holding fixed the same individual.  

g) With panel data, you can control for the effect of macroeconomic and aggregate factors 
using time fixed effects.  
 
 

  



15. (6 points, 2 points each) True or False (Event studies) 
a) The for-loop version of the event study R code we studied in class explicitly addresses 

the issue that events are overlapping (so that abnormal returns may be correlated across 
events) by using bootstrap standard errors, so that the t-stats produced by that R code is 
correct.  

b) The for-loop version of the event study R code  we studied in class did not address the 
issue that events are overlapping (so that abnormal returns may be correlated across 
events.) Therefore, the average CAR produced by that R code is incorrect.  

c) After defining the event and the window parameters, the event study estimates the 
normal return and the abnormal returns using data from the event window.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

16. (6 points) You are given with the following regression equation: 

 
a) Please explain the meaning and role of each of the variables and the coefficients in this 

regression equation. (2 points) 
 

b) Please give an expression for CAR(-1,1) under this regression model. (2 points) 
 
c) Provide one advantage and one disadvantage of this regression model, compared to the 

for-loop version of the event study R code we studied in class. (2 points)
