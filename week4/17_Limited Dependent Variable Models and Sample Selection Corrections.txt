        ● The Tobit model for corner solution responses
           • In many economic contexts, decision problems are such that either 
             a positive amount or a zero amount is chosen (e.g. demand for 
             alcohol)
           • A linear regression model may be inadequate in such cases as

                                              explanatory variables, the error term is 
                                              homoskedastic normally distributed

                            The final outcome of the dependent variable is positive or zero

         ●   Maximum likelihood estimation of the Tobit model


       For positive outcomes, the normal density (applied to               ) is used, for zero outcomes the 
       probability is one minus the probability that the latent variable is greater than zero (see Probit).

       Maximization of the log-likelihood:


       As in the Logit/Probit case, the maximization problem is highly nonlinear. It cannot be solved analy-
       tically and has to be solved with the help of computer software using e.g. Newton-Raphson methods.

                                                     The mean for all outcomes is a scaled version   
                                                     of the mean for only the positve outcomes (this 
                                                     is the reason why a regression using only the 
                                                     positive outcomes would yield wrong results)
         Conditional mean for positive outcomes:

                                                       The mean for only the positive outcomes is the 
                                                       usual linear regression but plus an extra term 
                                                       (this is again a reason why an ordinary linear

            Limited Dependent Variable Models and 
            Sample Selection Corrections

         ●   Example: Annual hours worked of married women

                                              Because of the different scaling factors involved, Tobit 
                                              coefficients are not comparable to OLS coefficients.

                                              To compare Tobit and OLS, one has to compare average 
                                              partial effects (or partial effects at the average). It turns 
                                              out that partial effects of Tobit and OLS are different in a 
                                              number of cases.

                                              Another difference between Tobit and OLS is that, due to 
                                              the linearity of the model, OLS assumes constant partial 
                                              effects, whereas partial effects are nonconstant in Tobit.

                                              In the given example, OLS yields negative annual hours 
                                              for 39 out of 753 women. This is not much but it may be 
                                              a reason to view the linear model as misspecified.

        ● Specification issues in Tobit/Logit/Probit models
           • A restriction of the Tobit model is that explanat. var. influence 
             positive outcomes and the probability of positive outcomes in the 
             same way
           • This may be unrealistic in many cases, for example, when modeling 
             the relationship between the amount of life insurance and a person‘s 
             age
           • For such cases, more advanced so-called hurdle models can be used
           • As in Logit/Probit models, heteroskedasticity may be an issue in 
             Tobit

                                             The expected number of arrests was 2.4 percentage points 
                                             lower if the average sentence length was 1 month higher.

                                             If the assumption of a Poisson distribution does not hold, 
                                             ML is still consistent and asymptotically normal. This is 
                                             called Quasi-Maximum Likelihood estimation (QML).

                                             If the distributional assumptions do not hold and QML is 
                                             used, standard errors are wrong. One then has to compute 
                                             robust standard errors (this has not been done here).

                                             Because                     there is evidence for overdispersion:

                                             This is evidence that the Poisson distribution does not hold 
                                             and robust standard errors have to be computed. 
                                             Alternatively one can inflate standard errors by   the factor.

         ●   Censored regression estimation of criminal recidivism

                                         The variable durat measures the time in months until a prison 
                                         inmate is arrested after being released from prison. Of 1,445 
                                         inmates, 893 had not been arrested during the time they were 
                                         followed. Their time out of prison is censored (because its end, 
                                         if there was one, was not observed).

                                         For example, if the time in prison was one month longer, this 
                                         reduced the expected duration until the next arrest by about 
                                         1.9%. 

                                         In the censored regression model, the coefficients can be di-

                                         linear but incompletely observed.

          Limited Dependent Variable Models and 
          Sample Selection Corrections

        ● Truncated regression models
           • In a truncated regression model the outcome and the explanatory 
             variables are only observed if the outcome is less or equal some 

             value ci
           • In this case, the sample is not a random sample from the population 
             (because some units will never be a part of the sample)
           • Truncated normal regression model:


                           only observed if

           • Applying OLS would not yield correct results because MLR.2 is 
             violated

                   ●       Sample selection corrections
                           •     The question is under which assumptions a sample with nonrandom 
                                 sample selection can be used to infer relationships in the population


                   ●       When is OLS on the selected sample consistent?

                                                                                                           Population model

          Limited Dependent Variable Models and 
          Sample Selection Corrections

        ● Three cases in which OLS on the selected sample is consistent
           • Selection is independent of explanatory variables and the error term
           • Selection is completely determined by explanatory variables
           • Selection depends on the explanatory variables and other factors 
             that are uncorrelated with the error term

        ● Similar results apply to IV/2SLS estimation
           • Instead of for explanatory variables, the conditions have to hold for   
             the full list of exogenous variables that are used in the model

        ● Sample selection and nonlinear models estimated by ML
           • Consistency if sample selection is only determined by explanat. var.

          Limited Dependent Variable Models and 
          Sample Selection Corrections

        ● Incidental truncation (Heckman model)

        ● Example: Wage offer function using sample of working women
           • One is interested in the wage of a woman with certain 
             characteristics would be offered on the labor market if she decided 
             to work
           • Unfortunately, one only observes the wages of women who actually 
             work, i.e. who have accepted the wage offered to them
           • The sample is truncated because women who do not work (but who 
             would be offered a wage if they asked for it) are never in the 
             sample
           • Truncation of this kind is called incidental truncation because it 
             depends on another variable (here: labor force participation)

         ●   Definition of Heckman model


                                    Main equation (e.g. wage equation)

                                             Selection equation (e.g. whether working)

                                             The error terms of both equations are jointly normally 
                                             distributed (independent of the explanatory variables) 
                                             with correlation coefficient    

         ●   Selection bias in OLS
                                                       For example, if the correlation of unobserved

            Sample Selection Corrections

         ●   Estimation of Heckman model

          1) Estimation of correction term:

                                               Estimate Probit for work decision using all ob-
                                               servations (working and nonworking women)

                                               Calculate inverse Mills ratio using Probit coefficients


        2) Include estimated correction term in regression:
                                                             If this coefficient is different from 
                                                             zero, there is nonignorable sample 
                                                             selection bias


                   There have to be explanatory variables in the selection equation that are not in 
                   the main equation (exclusion restrictions), otherwise there is multicollinearity 
                   because the inverse Mills ratio is almost linear in z
