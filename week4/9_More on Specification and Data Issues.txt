    ● Tests for functional form misspecification
     • One can always test whether explanatory should appear as squares 
       or higher order terms by testing whether such terms can be 
       excluded
     • Otherwise, one can use general specification tests such as RESET

    ● Regression specification error test (RESET)
     • The idea of RESET is to include squares and possibly higher order 
       fitted values in the regression (similarly to the reduced White test) 


      Test for the exclusion of these terms. If they cannot be excluded, this is evidence for 
      omitted higher order terms and interactions, i.e. for misspecification of functional form.

     • RESET provides little guidance as to where misspecification comes 
       from

    ● Using proxy variables for unobserved explanatory variables

    ● Example: Omitted ability in a wage equation Replace by proxy 


     In general, the estimates for the returns to education and experience will be biased because 
     one has omit the unobservable ability variable. Idea: find a proxy variable for ability which is 
     able to control for ability differences between individuals so that the coefficients of the other 
     variables will not be biased. A possible proxy for ability is the IQ score or similar test scores.

    ● General approach to use proxy variables


                         Omitted variable, e.g. ability

    ● Assumptions necessary for the proxy variable method to work
     • The proxy is “just a proxy” for the omitted variable, it does not 
       belong into the population regression, i.e. it is uncorrelated with its 
       error
                  If the error and the proxy were correlated, the proxy 
                  would actually have to be included in the population 
                  regression function

     • The proxy variable is a “good” proxy for the omitted variable, i.e. 
       using other variables in addition will not help to predict the omitted 
       variable

    ● Under these assumptions, the proxy variable method works:


      In this regression model, the error term is uncorrelated with all the explanatory variables. As 
      a consequence, all coefficients will be correctly estimated using OLS. The coefficents for the 

      explanatory variables x1 and x2 will be correctly identified. The coefficient for the proxy va-
      riable may also be of interest (it is a multiple of the coefficient of the omitted variable).

    ● Discussion of the proxy assumptions in the wage example
     • Assumption 1: Should be fullfilled as IQ score is not a direct wage 
       determinant
     • Assumption 2: Most of the variation in ability should be explainable 
       by variation in IQ score, leaving no rest to educ and exper

                        As expected, the measured return to 
                        education decreases if IQ is included 
                        as a proxy for unobserved ability.

                        The coefficient for the proxy suggests 
                        that ability differences between indivi-
                        duals are important (e.g. +15 points 
                        IQ score are associated with a wage 
                        increase of 5.4 percentage points).

                        Even if IQ score imperfectly soaks up 
                        the variation caused by ability, inclu-
                        ding it will at least reduce the bias in 
                        the measured return to education.

                        No significant interaction effect bet-
                        ween ability and education.

    ● Using lagged dependent variables as proxy variables
     • In many cases, omitted unobserved factors may be proxied by the 
       value of the dependent variable from an earlier time period

    ● Example: City crime rates


     • Including the past crime rate will at least partly control for the many 
       omitted factors that also determine the crime rate in a given year
     • Another way to interpret this equation is that one compares cities 
       which had the same crime rate last year; this avoids comparing 
       cities that differ very much in unobserved crime factors

    ● Consequences of measurement error in an explanatory variable
     • Under the classical errors-in-variables assumption, OLS is biased and 
       inconsistent because the mismeasured variable is endogenous
     • One can show that the inconsistency is of the following form:

                      This factor (which involves the error 
                      variance of a regression of the true value 

                      of x1 on the other explanatory variables) 
                      will always be between zero and one
     • The effect of the mismeasured variable suffers from attenuation 
       bias, i.e. the magnitude of the effect will be attenuated towards zero
     • In addition, the effects of the other explanatory variables will be 
       biased

    ● Missing data and nonrandom samples

    ● Missing data as sample selection
     • Missing data is a special case of sample selection (= nonrandom 
       sampling) as the observations with missing information cannot be 
       used
     • If the sample selection is based on independent variables there is no 
       problem as a regression conditions on the independent variables
     • In general, sample selection is no problem if it is uncorrelated with 
       the error term of a regression (= exogenous sample selection)

       variable or on the error term (= endogenous sample selection)

    ● Example for exogenous sample selection


   If the sample was nonrandom in the way that certain age groups, income groups, or household sizes 
   were over- or undersampled, this is not a problem for the regression because it examines the savings 
   for subgroups defined by income, age, and hh-size. The distribution of subgroups does not matter.

    ● Example for endogenous sample selection


   If the sample is nonrandom in the way individuals refuse to take part in the sample survey if their 
   wealth is particularly high or low, this will bias the regression results because these individuals may 
   be systematically different from those who do not refuse to take part in the sample survey.

    ● Outliers and influential observations
     • Extreme values and outliers may be a particular problem for OLS 
       because the method is based on squaring deviations
     • If outliers are the result of mistakes that occured when keying in the 
       data, one should just discard the affected observations
     • If outliers are the result of the data generating process, the decision 
       whether to discard the outliers is not so easy

    ● Least absolute deviations estimation (LAD)
     • The least absolute deviations estimator minimizes the sum of 
       absolute deviations (instead of the sum of squared deviations, i.e. 
       OLS)


     • It may be more robust to outliers as deviations are not squared
     • The least absolute deviations estimator estimates the parameters of 
       the conditional median (instead of the conditional mean with OLS)
     • The least absolute deviations estimator is a special case of quantile 
       regression, which estimates parameters of conditional quantiles
