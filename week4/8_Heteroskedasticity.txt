        ●  Consequences of heteroskedasticity for OLS
           • OLS still unbiased and consistent under heteroskedastictiy!

           • Also, interpretation of R-squared is not changed

                                   Unconditional error variance is unaffected 
                                   by heteroskedasticity (which refers to the 
                                   conditional error variance) 

           • Heteroskedasticity invalidates variance formulas for OLS estimators

           • The usual F tests and t tests are not valid under heteroskedasticity 

           • Under heteroskedasticity, OLS is no longer the best linear unbiased 
             estimator (BLUE); there may be more efficient linear estimators

          HeteroskedasticityHeteroskedasticity

        ● Heteroskedasticity-robust inference after OLS estimation
           • Formulas for OLS standard errors and related statistics have been 
             developed that are robust to heteroskedasticity of unknown form
           • All formulas are only valid in large samples
           • Formula for heteroskedasticity-robust OLS standard error
                                    Also called White/Huber/Eicker standard errors. They 
                                    involve the squared residuals from the regression and 

                                    from a regression of xj on all other explanatory 
                                    variables.
           • Using these formulas, the usual t test is valid asymptotically
           • The usual F statistic does not work under heteroskedasticity, but 
             heteroskedasticity robust versions are available in most software

         ●   Example: Hourly wage equation


                                                  Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors may be 
                                                  larger or smaller than their nonrobust counterparts. 
                                                  The differences are often small in practice.


                                           F statistics are also often not too different.

                                      If there is strong heteroskedasticity, differences may be larger. 
                                      To be on the safe side, it is advisable to always compute robust 
                                      standard errors.

                    ●      Testing for heteroskedasticity
                            •     It may still be interesting whether there is heteroskedasticity 
                                  because then OLS may not be the most efficient linear estimator 
                                  anymore

          If errors are homoskedastic at the individual-level, WLS with weights equal to firm size mi should 
          be used. If the assumption of homoskedasticity at the individual-level is not exactly right, one can 
          calculate robust standard errors after WLS (i.e. for the transformed model).

          HeteroskedasticityHeteroskedasticity

        ● What if the assumed heteroskedasticity function is wrong?
           • If the heteroskedasticity function is misspecified, WLS is still 
             consistent under MLR.1 – MLR.4, but robust standard errors should 
             be computed
           • WLS is consistent under MLR.4 but not necessarily under MLR.4‘


           • If OLS and WLS produce very different estimates, this typically indi-
             cates that some other assumptions (e.g. MLR.4) are wrong
           • If there is strong heteroskedasticity, it is still often better to use a 
             wrong form of heteroskedasticity in order to increase efficiency
