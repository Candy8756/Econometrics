  Note: This ﬁgure plots the 2003-2012 growth rate in (residual) housing value over the growth
  rate in (residual) household wealth. The residuals are constructed by regressing log housing value
  and log household wealth on log income and log population. Left: Wealth including housing.
  Right: Wealth excluding housing (which is simply household bank savings).

homes. The coeﬃcients on log(wealth) are similar whether I include or exclude housing
from household wealth, suggesting that the estimated tight relationship is not due simply
to regressing housing on housing.
  Figure 2 graphically illustrates the tight relationship between increases in the total
value of homes and increases in household (total or non-housing) wealth. Log housing
value and log household wealth are ﬁrst regressed on log income and log population. I
take the regression residuals and plot the 2003–2012 growth rate in (residual) housing
value over the growth rate in (residual) household wealth, including or excluding housing.
Again, the slope of the ﬁtted line representing the association between increases in the
total value of homes and increases in household wealth is similar and close to one, whether
I include or exclude housing from household wealth.
  The one-to-one association between increases in the total value of homes and increases
in household (total or non-housing) wealth is quite robust. Speciﬁcally, it is robust to: (1)

 is uncorrelated with growth in income, electricity use, industrial proﬁts, the number of
 taxis, elementary school population and bank loans; among the seven dimensions of local
 economy examined, only population growth is correlated with famine severity, but the
 correlation is negative, and unlikely to explain the positive instrumental variable results.

3.    Proposed Mechanism and Institutional Background

   Financial market frictions together with an upward transition in Chinese household
wealth provide a mechanism that potentially explains the large increase in housing prices,
the large and declining housing return premium, and the faster-than-income-growth in-
crease in housing values that is linked one-to-one with the increase in household wealth.
   The mechanism operates as follows. A low initial wealth and borrowing constraints
limit the amount of investable funds, thereby generating a low price for homes in 2003.
Subsequently, household savings from low initial household wealth generate a transitional

    Note: This table reports placebo tests for the famine severity instrument for wealth accumula-
    tion. The dependent variables are 9-year long growth rates of income, electricity use, industrial
    proﬁts, number of taxis, population, elementary school enrollment, as well as bank credit at
    the city-level, during 2003-2012. The independent variable is famine severity, as measured by
    the abnormal loss of birth cohort size during 1959-1961 at the local level in the 1990 Census,
    following Meng, Qian and Yared (2015). Standard errors are clustered at the province level.
