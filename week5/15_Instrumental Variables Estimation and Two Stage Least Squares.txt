     ● The endogeneity problem is endemic in social 
      sciences/economics
      • In many cases important personal variables cannot be observed
      • These are often correlated with observed explanatory information
      • In addition, measurement error may also lead to endogeneity
      • Solutions to endogeneity problems considered so far:
         • Proxy variables method for omitted regressors
         • Fixed effects methods if 1) panel data is available, 2) endogeneity is 
          time-constant, and 3) regressors are not time-constant

     ● Instrumental variables method (IV)
      • IV is the most well-known method to address endogeneity problems

     ● Motivation: Omitted Variables in a Simple Regression Model

     ● Example: Education in a wage equation
                              Error terms contains factors 
                              such as innate ability which 
                              are correlated with education
     ● Definition of a instrumental variable:
      • 1) It does not appear in the regression
      • 2) It is highly correlated with the endogenous variable
      • 3) It is uncorrelated with the error term

     ● An simple consistency proof for OLS under exogeneity:

                  (Exogeneity)


       This holds as long as the data are such that sample variances and cova-
       riances converge to their theoretical counterparts as n  1, i.e. if a LLN 
       holds. OLS will basically be consistent if, and only if, exogeneity holds.

     ● Assume existence of an instrumental variable   :

                           The instrumental variable is un-
                           correlated with the error term

     ● Example: Father‘s education as an IV for education

   OLS:                         Return to education 
                                probably overestimated


                           Is the education of the father a good IV?
                           1) It doesn‘t appear as regressor
                           2) It is significantly correlated with educ
                           3) It is uncorrelated with the error (?)

                                The estimated return to 
                                education decreases 
   IV:                          (which is to be expected)
                                It is also much less

     ● Other IVs for education that have been used in the literature:

     ● The number of siblings
      • 1) No wage determinant, 2) Correlated with education because of 
        resource constraints in hh, 3) Uncorrelated with innate ability

     ● College proximity when 16 years old
      • 1) No wage determinant, 2) Correlated with education because 
        more education if lived near college, 3) Uncorrelated with error (?)

     ● Month of birth
      • 1) No wage determinant, 2) Correlated with education because of 
        compulsory school attendance laws, 3) Uncorrelated with error

     ● Properties of IV with a poor instrumental variable
      • IV may be much more inconsistent than OLS if the instrumental 
        variable is not completely exogenous and only weakly related to   


                               There is no problem if the 
                               instrumental variable is really 
                               exogenous. If not, the asymp-
                               totic bias will be the larger the 
                               weaker the correlation with x.

                                  This is the so called 
                                  “reduced form regression”

     ● Computing IV estimates in the multiple regression case:

       Exogeneity conditions:

                         as well as

       Use sample analogs of the exogeneity conditions:


       This yields k+1 equations from which the k+1 estimates                         can be obtained.

     ● Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) estimation
      • It turns out that the IV estimator is equivalent to the following     
        procedure, which has a much more intuitive interpretation:


     First stage (= reduced form regression): The endogenous explanatory variable y2 is 
                           predicted using only exogenous information

                                  Additional exogenous 
                                  variable (= instrument)


             Second stage (= OLS with y2 replaced by its prediction from the first stage):

      andand  TwoTwo  StageStage  LeastLeast  SquaresSquares

     ● Why does Two Stage Least Squares work?
      • All variables in the second stage regression are exogenous because    

        y2 was replaced by a prediction based on only exogenous 
        information

      • By using the prediction based on exogenous information, y2 is 
        purged of its endogenous part (the part that is related to the error 
        term)

     ● Properties of Two Stage Least Squares
      • The standard errors from the OLS second stage regression are 
        wrong. However, it is not difficult to compute correct standard 
        errors.
      • If there is one endogenous variable and one instrument then 2SLS = 
        IV
      • The 2SLS estimation can also be used if there is more than one 
        endo-genous variable and at least as many instruments

     ● Example: 2SLS in a wage equation using two instruments

       First stage regression (regress educ on all exogenous variables):


                                 Education is significantly 
                                 partially correlated with the 
                                 education of the parents

       Two Stage Least Squares estimation results:


                        The return to education is much lower but 
                        also much more imprecise than with OLS

     ● Using 2SLS/IV as a solution to errors-in-variables problems
      • If a second measurement of the mismeasured variable is available, 
        this can be used as an instrumental variable for the mismeasured 
        variable

     ● Statistical properties of 2SLS/IV-estimation
      • Under assumptions completely analogous to OLS, but conditioning 
        on     rather than on    , 2SLS/IV is consistent and asymptotically 
        normal

      • 2SLS/IV is typically much less precise because there is more 
        multicollinearity and less explanatory variation in the second stage 
        regression
      • Corrections for heteroskedasticity/serial correlation analogous to 
        OLS
      • 2SLS/IV easily extends to time series and panel data situations

     ● Testing for endogeneity of explanatory variables


                      Variable that is suspected to be endogenous

         Reduced form regression:


     Variable y2 is exogenous if and only if v2 is uncorrelated with u1, i.e. if 
     the parameter      is zero in the regression:


                    The null hypothesis of exogeneity of y2 is rejected, 
                    if in this regression the parameter     is significantly 
     Test equation: different from zero
